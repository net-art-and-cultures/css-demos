# css-demos

the following is by no means an exhaustive list of CSS properties (u can check those out [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference) or [here](https://css-tricks.com/almanac/)), nor is it a general guide to all CSS features (for that checkout Jon Duckett's book [HTML & CSS](http://www.htmlandcssbook.com/) or the Mozilla Developers Network's [CSS tutorials](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/CSS/Getting_started)). the following are some examples/demos highlighting specific CSS properties or issues/questions i often get asked about in class (i can add more to this page if there's something we end up covering in class that isn't on here, just send me an email about what u'd like to see explained)

for a general introduction to what CSS is, how u include it in an HTML page && what the basic structure && syntax of the code is (blocks, selectors, properties, values, etc) refer to the class notes on [CSS](https://github.com/net-art-and-cultures/syllabus-and-notes/tree/master/notes/css). while CSS is typically used for page layout && styling (fonts, colors, etc) there is an active && creative community producing all sorts of experiments that push CSS to it's limits && use it in unconventional ways, for some examples of this "CSS Art" check out this curatedl ist of "[codepens](https://codepen.io/)" (a code sharing + social media site popular among the CSS community) in the class notes under [CSS Art Gallery](https://github.com/net-art-and-cultures/syllabus-and-notes/tree/master/notes/css-gallery)


# how to make use of this repo

u can follow the examples below in order (it more or less goes from basic to less-basic) or u can jump around to specific topics u want to learn more about. clicking the links will take u to another markdown page (a `.md` file) w/documentation on that particular subject (these are also found in the "notes" directory of this repo) && those pages will link to different HTML pages w/the CSS examples in them (these are also found in the "demos" directory of this repo).

...mention inspector tool...

u can look through these notes && examples && copy+paste any bits of code that u want to reuse/remix, but u could also "clone" this repo so that u can have a local copy on ur computer && experiment w/these examples that way. keep in mind i own this repo (not u) so if u make any changes && try to "push" those back up to this repo, u won't be able to b/c u're not authorized. that said, u can "fork" this repo to make ur own copy on ur GitHub account. if u clone ur forked version of the repo u will be able to push any changes u make back up to ur forked copy. then if u create any new examples u want to share back u can submit a "pull request" so that ur changes can be included in this original repo :)
